# Analysis-of-Random-Variables-and-Random-Processes
This project introduces a MATLAB-based, GUI-driven tool for the analysis of random variables and stochastic processes, tailored for advanced applications in probability theory and statistics. The tool allows users to input random variables and stochastic processes and conduct detailed statistical analyses.
